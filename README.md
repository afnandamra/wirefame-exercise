### Reflections and Comments
* How did this go, overall?
It went well, it was fun but we need to practice more
* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
CSS is fun!
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
It took 2 hours (as I thought), but it should take less.
